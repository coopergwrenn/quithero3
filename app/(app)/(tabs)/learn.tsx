      content: `Complete Guide to Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)

MEDICAL DISCLAIMER: This information is for educational purposes only. Always consult your healthcare provider before starting any NRT. This is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

What is NRT?

Nicotine Replacement Therapy provides controlled doses of nicotine without the harmful chemicals found in cigarettes. It helps manage withdrawal symptoms while you break behavioral habits.

Types of NRT

Nicotine Patches
‚Ä¢ Deliver steady nicotine through skin over 16-24 hours
‚Ä¢ Reduce overall withdrawal symptoms
‚Ä¢ Most convenient option - apply once daily

Dosing guidelines:
‚Ä¢ 21mg patch: For heavy smokers (20+ cigarettes/day)
‚Ä¢ 14mg patch: For moderate smokers (10-19 cigarettes/day)
‚Ä¢ 7mg patch: For light smokers (<10 cigarettes/day) or step-down

Step-down protocol:
‚Ä¢ Start with appropriate dose for 6-8 weeks
‚Ä¢ Step down to next lower dose for 2-4 weeks
‚Ä¢ Step down to lowest dose for 2-4 weeks
‚Ä¢ Total treatment: 10-16 weeks

Nicotine Gum
‚Ä¢ Fast-acting nicotine absorption through mouth lining
‚Ä¢ User controls timing and amount
‚Ä¢ Helps with hand-to-mouth habit

Dosing:
‚Ä¢ 4mg gum: For heavy smokers or strong cravings
‚Ä¢ 2mg gum: For light-moderate smokers

Proper technique:
‚Ä¢ Chew slowly until peppery taste appears
‚Ä¢ "Park" between cheek and gum for 20-30 minutes
‚Ä¢ Do NOT continuously chew like regular gum
‚Ä¢ Avoid eating/drinking 15 minutes before and during use

Nicotine Lozenges
‚Ä¢ Dissolve slowly in mouth for steady nicotine release
‚Ä¢ No chewing required
‚Ä¢ Discrete and convenient

Dosing:
‚Ä¢ 4mg lozenge: If you smoke within 30 minutes of waking
‚Ä¢ 2mg lozenge: If you smoke more than 30 minutes after waking

Combination Therapy

Patch + Fast-Acting NRT:
‚Ä¢ Patch provides steady baseline nicotine
‚Ä¢ Gum/lozenge handles breakthrough cravings
‚Ä¢ Studies show 15-25% higher success rates
‚Ä¢ Always consult healthcare provider first

Choosing the Right NRT

Consider patches if you:
‚Ä¢ Want convenience (once daily)
‚Ä¢ Have steady cravings throughout day
‚Ä¢ Don't want to think about timing
‚Ä¢ Have jaw problems preventing gum use

Consider gum/lozenges if you:
‚Ä¢ Have irregular smoking patterns
‚Ä¢ Want control over timing and dose
‚Ä¢ Have skin sensitivity to patches
‚Ä¢ Need help with hand-to-mouth habit

Success Tips

‚Ä¢ Start on quit day: Don't wait for cravings to begin
‚Ä¢ Use full recommended duration: Don't stop early
‚Ä¢ Combine with behavioral support: Apps, counseling, support groups
‚Ä¢ Be patient: NRT reduces but doesn't eliminate all cravings
‚Ä¢ Step down gradually: Sudden stopping may trigger relapse

Remember: NRT is a tool, not a magic cure. Success rates double when NRT is used properly compared to willpower alone!`
